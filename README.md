jQuery Impression
=================
Uses LocalStorage to save values entered into form fields so that on refresh or navigate away and back, the values
remain. Useful for often used <form>s which receive little to no alteration over subsequent submission.

At BlackLocus, this saves us a lot of keystrokes on internal tooling UIs.
